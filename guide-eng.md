## 1. GENERAL INFORMATION: WE HOPE THIS GUIDE REMAINS UNUSED  

Not every protest turns chaotic. Many demonstrations are peaceful and impactful, enabling people to express their voices effectively. This guide exists to help you stay safe if unexpected situations arise, but ideally, you won’t need it.  

### **Stay Vigilant Against Provocations**  

- **Beware of Agitators**: Some individuals or groups may attempt to escalate tensions. Avoid engaging with those inciting violence or confrontation, as this can put both you and others at risk.  
- **Remain Calm and Focused**: Protests are most effective when they remain peaceful. Do not let fear, anger, or external provocation drive you into unsafe actions.  
- **Be Mindful of Disinformation**: False information can spread quickly in high-energy environments. Always verify news and instructions from reliable sources before acting on them.  

### **Use the Buddy System**  

- **Go with a Trusted Partner**: Attending a protest with someone you trust enhances safety. A companion can assist if you are separated, injured, or detained.  
- **Establish Communication Plans**: Set a meeting point in case of separation, and agree on a method of contact. If cell networks are unreliable, consider using offline messaging apps like Briar or setting up pre-determined check-in times.  
- **Look Out for Each Other**: If someone in your group is struggling—whether physically, emotionally, or legally—offer help or seek support from medics and legal observers.  

### **Understand Your Rights**  

- **Know the Law in Your Country**: Familiarize yourself with the laws on assembly, speech, and police interactions. In the U.S., the **ACLU’s “Know Your Rights”** resources are a good starting point. In other countries, check civil rights organizations for similar guidelines.  
- **You Have the Right to Record (in Many Places)**: In many jurisdictions, filming public officials, including police, is legal. However, some countries have restrictions, so know the law beforehand.  
- **Stay Silent if Detained**: If arrested, you generally have the right to remain silent and request legal counsel. Avoid offering unnecessary information until you have proper legal advice.  

### **Prioritize Safety and Preparation**  

- **Plan Before You Go**: Research the protest organizers, their goals, and any necessary permits. Understanding the event’s structure helps you stay aligned with its purpose and aware of potential risks.  
- **Stay Updated**: Monitor official channels, trusted journalists, or legal observers for real-time updates. Be aware of any sudden changes in police presence or emergency situations.  
- **Assess the Risks Objectively**: Some protests are low-risk, while others might carry higher chances of escalation. Gauge the situation realistically and prepare accordingly.  

By staying vigilant, informed, and proactive, you can help make protests safer for yourself and others. Protesting is a fundamental right in many countries, and when done responsibly, it can be a powerful tool for change. **We hope this guide remains unused—but if the need arises, we want you to be prepared.**
