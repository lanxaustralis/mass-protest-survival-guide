## 1. GENERAL INFORMATION: WE HOPE THIS GUIDE REMAINS UNUSED  

Not every protest turns chaotic. Many demonstrations are peaceful and impactful, enabling people to express their voices effectively. This guide exists to help you stay safe if unexpected situations arise, but ideally, you won’t need it.  

### **Stay Vigilant Against Provocations**  

- **Beware of Agitators**: Some individuals or groups may attempt to escalate tensions. Avoid engaging with those inciting violence or confrontation, as this can put both you and others at risk.  
- **Remain Calm and Focused**: Protests are most effective when they remain peaceful. Do not let fear, anger, or external provocation drive you into unsafe actions.  
- **Be Mindful of Disinformation**: False information can spread quickly in high-energy environments. Always verify news and instructions from reliable sources before acting on them.  

### **Use the Buddy System**  

- **Go with a Trusted Partner**: Attending a protest with someone you trust enhances safety. A companion can assist if you are separated, injured, or detained.  
- **Establish Communication Plans**: Set a meeting point in case of separation, and agree on a method of contact. If cell networks are unreliable, consider using offline messaging apps like Briar or setting up pre-determined check-in times.  
- **Look Out for Each Other**: If someone in your group is struggling—whether physically, emotionally, or legally—offer help or seek support from medics and legal observers.  

### **Understand Your Rights**  

- **Know the Law in Your Country**: Familiarize yourself with the laws on assembly, speech, and police interactions. In the U.S., the **ACLU’s “Know Your Rights”** resources are a good starting point. In other countries, check civil rights organizations for similar guidelines.  
- **You Have the Right to Record (in Many Places)**: In many jurisdictions, filming public officials, including police, is legal. However, some countries have restrictions, so know the law beforehand.  
- **Stay Silent if Detained**: If arrested, you generally have the right to remain silent and request legal counsel. Avoid offering unnecessary information until you have proper legal advice.  

### **Prioritize Safety and Preparation**  

- **Plan Before You Go**: Research the protest organizers, their goals, and any necessary permits. Understanding the event’s structure helps you stay aligned with its purpose and aware of potential risks.  
- **Stay Updated**: Monitor official channels, trusted journalists, or legal observers for real-time updates. Be aware of any sudden changes in police presence or emergency situations.  
- **Assess the Risks Objectively**: Some protests are low-risk, while others might carry higher chances of escalation. Gauge the situation realistically and prepare accordingly.  

By staying vigilant, informed, and proactive, you can help make protests safer for yourself and others. Protesting is a fundamental right in many countries, and when done responsibly, it can be a powerful tool for change. **We hope this guide remains unused—but if the need arises, we want you to be prepared.**

## 2. BEFORE YOU GO

## 3. DURING THE PROTEST  

### **Situational Awareness**  
- Stay aware of surroundings: police lines, kettling, exits.  
- Stick with a group or trusted buddy.  
- Avoid corners and dead ends.  

### **Dealing with Confrontation**  

#### **Tear Gas Response**  
- Stay calm and breathe slowly.  
- Move uphill and upwind.  
- Use goggles and mask. **Do NOT use swimming goggles with contact lenses.**  
- Rinse eyes with saline or clean water.  
- Baby shampoo (tear-free) can help break down oily residues but **should NOT be applied during exposure.**  

#### **Water Cannon**  
- Protect head and chest.  
- Avoid slick ground.  
- Use obstacles for cover.  

#### **Plastic Bullets**  
- Seek hard cover.  
- Do not provoke.  
- Move calmly but swiftly.  

### **Protecting Face & Eyes**  
- **Best option**: Full-face respirator with P100 filters.  
- **Backup**: N95 mask + sealed lab goggles.  
- **Create a seal**: Ensure goggles fit snugly under/over mask.  
- **Bring spares**: extra goggles, cloth mask in sealed plastic bags.

## 4. IF ARRESTED  
- Stay calm. Do not resist.  
- Clearly state:  
  - *“I do not consent to a search. I want a lawyer.”*  
- Remain silent. **Do not explain, argue, or sign anything without legal advice.**  
- Use your memorized legal contact and emergency number.

## 5. AFTER THE PROTEST  
- **Wash clothes separately.**  
  - Rinse yourself with cold water first to remove chemical residues.  
- **Debrief**: Write down incidents, injuries, or abuses.  
- **Avoid social media posts** with identifiable images.  
- **Support others**: Check on fellow protesters, donate to legal aid/bail funds.

## 6. LASTLY...

A protest is not always a momentary event — it can be part of a long-term struggle. To remain effective, you need to protect your **mental, physical, and emotional well-being**.

### **Act with Intention and Preserve Your Energy**  
- **You don’t have to engage in every confrontation.**  
  - Getting arrested or taking unnecessary risks can drain your energy and undermine your goals.  
  - Strength in protest isn’t just about standing firm today — it’s about staying committed in the long run.  
- **Sometimes, stepping back is the smartest move.**  
  - Don’t act on impulse. Evaluate the situation, understand the risks, and prioritize your safety.  
  - Resistance isn’t always loud or physical — sometimes, it’s strategic and quiet.  

### **Be Alert to Provocations: Protect the Legitimacy of the Movement**  
- Even when your rights are legally protected, **there may be efforts to delegitimize your cause.**  
  - Not everyone in the crowd may share your goals.  
  - Some individuals might try to provoke conflict or introduce slogans and banners that could derail the protest’s message.  
  - If you notice such behavior, don’t confront it alone. Calmly point it out and ask others around you to help de-escalate.  
  - Group awareness is a powerful tool — together, you can prevent provocations from taking hold.  
- **Movements gain strength from discipline and clarity, not just volume.**  
  - Strategy and composure are what make voices truly heard.  

### **Stay Calm, Even in the Worst Moments**  
- If tensions rise — during arrests, tear gas deployment, or crowd dispersals — do your best to remain calm.  
- Focus on what you’ve prepared for: your breathing, your safety plan, your support system.  
- Fear is natural, but don’t let it lead your actions. You are most powerful when you remain steady.
